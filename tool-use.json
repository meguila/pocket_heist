    "content":  "# Spec for Authentication Forms\n\nbranch: claude/feature/auth-forms\nfigma_component (if used): N/A\n\n## Summary\n\n- Add Login and Signup forms to the `/login` and `/signup` public pages respectively.\n- Each form includes email and password fields, a toggle to show/hide the password, and a submit button.\n- On submission, form data is logged to the console (no real auth yet).\n- Both pages link to each other so users can easily switch between the two forms.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n- The `/login` page renders a Login form with:\n  - An email input field (type email)\n  - A password input field with a show/hide toggle icon\n  - A \"Login\" submit button\n  - A link to the `/signup` page (\"Don\u0027t have an account? Sign up\")\n- The `/signup` page renders a Signup form with:\n  - An email input field (type email)\n  - A password input field with a show/hide toggle icon\n  - A \"Sign Up\" submit button\n  - A link to the `/login` page (\"Already have an account? Log in\")\n- The password field includes a clickable icon that toggles the input type between `password` and `text`\n- On form submission, the email and password values are logged to the browser console\n- The form does not navigate or perform any network request on submit\n- Both forms are rendered inside the existing `(public)` route group, so no navbar is shown\n\n## Figma Design Reference (only if referenced)\n\n- File: N/A\n- Component name: N/A\n- Key visual constraints: N/A\n\n## Possible Edge Cases\n\n- User submits the form with empty fields ÔÇö still logs (or logs empty strings); no validation required at this stage\n- User toggles password visibility multiple times ÔÇö the field value must be preserved across toggles\n- User navigates between Login and Signup ÔÇö each page should render its own independent form state\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Visiting `/login` renders a form with email, password (hidden by default), and a \"Login\" button\n- Visiting `/signup` renders a form with email, password (hidden by default), and a \"Sign Up\" button\n- Clicking the password toggle icon switches the field between masked and unmasked\n- Submitting either form logs `{ email, password }` (or similar) to the browser console\n- Each page contains a navigation link that takes the user to the other auth page\n- No navbar is visible on either page\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- Should form fields show any inline validation errors in a future iteration, or remain purely console-only until auth is wired up?\n- Is there a preferred icon library for the show/hide password icon, or should a simple SVG be used?\n- Should both forms share a single reusable `AuthForm` component, or remain as separate page-level implementations?\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n\nCreate a test file(s) in the ./tests folder for the new feature, and create meaningful tests for the following cases, without going too heavy:\n\n- Renders the email and password fields\n- Renders the correct submit button label (\"Login\" vs \"Sign Up\")\n- Password field is masked by default (type=\"password\")\n- Clicking the toggle icon switches the password field to type=\"text\" and back\n- Submitting the form calls console.log with the entered email and password\n- The link to the other auth page is present and points to the correct route\n"
